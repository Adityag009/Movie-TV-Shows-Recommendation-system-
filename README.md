# Movie-TV-Shows-Recommendation-system

### In this project, I have developed a recommendation system for movies and TV shows. To create this system, I concatenated the datasets of popular streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and Hotstar. Then, I used text vectorization and cosine similarity to find similar movies and TV shows based on the user's input movie.

### To be specific, I used CountVectorizer to convert the text data into vectors, which represent the frequency of words in each movie or TV show's description. Then, I used cosine similarity to measure the similarity between the vectors of the input movie and all the other movies and TV shows in the dataset. The top 5 recommendations were selected based on their cosine similarity scores.

### To use the recommendation system, the user can input the title of a movie or TV show they have enjoyed and the system will recommend 5 similar movies or TV shows to watch next.
